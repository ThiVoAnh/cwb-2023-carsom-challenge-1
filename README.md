# CWB 2023 - Carsome challenge 1

Web application to predict the car price

## Description


Problem Statement: By looking at auction data, we needed your help to come up with a pricing algorithm for Carsomeâ€™s business that can accurately predict the ideal price range of the car, and them come up with a comprehensive data-driven sourcing strategy for identifying cars that should be purchased by Carsome.

Challenge I - Car Price Prediction

If you can estimate the price that a seller is willing to sell, or the price that a buyer is willing to buy, you can make your product or service more attractive by offering the right prices to your customers. Can we know at what price P, a car C can fetch in the market, at time T?

Hints:

What are the top car brands and models?
How does auction date or car mileage correlate with car prices?
Goal:

To predict the selling price of given cars in the inventory with the lowest error.

## Data

The dataset is given by Carsome

## Requirements
Python, Jupyter Notebook and the list of libraries:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
